# Open World Game
In this game, players encounter objects in the world that they can pick up.  If they pick up a food item,
it is consumed and the energy directly applies to the playerâ€™s health.  The player can also pick up and
add enhancements to increase the damage and durability of their weapon

The achievements system will also be implemented, which rewards the player badges for various
accomplishments. The HUD (head-up display) system will display the player state.

When the player first encounters a ham, the system will give them an option to equip it as a weapon.  From there, the
player can add enhancements to their new ham weapon.

When the player is presented with a ham, they are given the choice to add it as a new weapon.  After it is assigned as the
HamWepon, the player can choose to upgrade it with enhancements found in the world.  Any
other hams found in the world will only be consumed for energy
